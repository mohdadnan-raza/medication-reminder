# Medication Reminder System – Node.js + Twilio

This is a simple voice-based medication reminder system built as part of a take-home assignment for DTxPlus. It uses Twilio to call patients, play a medication reminder, record their response, and log the interaction.

## Features

- Trigger voice calls using a REST API
- Remind patients via Text-to-Speech
- Record and transcribe their responses
- Log call SID, status, transcription, timestamp, and recording URL
- View logs using a GET API
- Live deployed using Railway

## How It Works

1. You send a `POST /call` request with the patient’s phone number.
2. The app uses Twilio to make a voice call.
3. Twilio plays a reminder message.
4. It records the patient’s spoken response.
5. The response is transcribed and logged.
6. You can view logs at `GET /logs`.
